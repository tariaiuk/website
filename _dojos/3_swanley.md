sensei_name: Anna Stone Sensei, 6th Dan Renshi
sensei_bio: "Anna Stone Sensei has been an integral part of the Iaido landscape for over four decades, marking this year as her 40th anniversary in the discipline. Her journey in Iaido commenced under the guidance of Fujii Okimitsu Sensei, whose teachings continue to influence her practice and teaching philosophy. The foundational insights gained during these formative years remain a guiding light in her approach to Iaido.<br><br>
The wisdom of Haruna Sensei, renowned for his kindness and unparalleled knowledge of technique, further shaped Anna Sensei's path. His teachings were instrumental in her progression to rokudan (6th dan), a testament to his patience and mentorship. <br><br> 
Anna Sensei has also made significant contributions to the Iaido community, not only by representing the UK in European competitions but also by serving as a National Coach for the British Kendo Association. Through her dedication, she has been pivotal in developing the BKA coaching awards for Level 1 and Level 2, nurturing the next generation of Iaido practitioners."

# Our Dojo
Welcome to Dartford Dojo, a sanctuary of Iaido since the early 2005, where the art has been nurtured and cherished for decades. The Dojo's history is interleaved with that of Anna Stone Sensei: it is rich with tradition and the influence of esteemed patrons such as Fujii Okimitsu Sensei and Haruna Sensei. Their profound teachings have left an indelible mark on our community, guiding our practice and enriching our understanding of Iai.

In recent times, our affiliation with the Tokyo Adachi Roshukai, guided by the esteemed Honda Sensei, has introduced new dimensions to our practice, enhancing our collective journey with additional layers of depth and insight.
At Dartford Dojo, we celebrate the legacy of our past, the dedication of our present, and the promise of our future. We are a small and friendly Dojo and we welcome beginners at any time.
