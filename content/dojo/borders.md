David McLean has been involved in Iaido since the early 2001. He helped found the Edinburgh club under tuition from John Honisz-Green Sensei and took over Dojo Leader role whilst Honisz-Greens sensei was in Japan. In 2014 David moved to Leitholm in the Scottish Borders to run a small village Inn and continued to co-teach at the Edinburgh Club. In 2017, he decided to start a club in the Borders and subsequent leadership was transferred to the two most senior students in the Edinburgh Club.  

The Tokyo Adachi Roshukai - Border is registered with the BKA and David is a recognised BKA Regional Coach.
