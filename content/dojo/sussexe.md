Nicholas (Nick) started training in Iaido in 2000 following the advice his late Aikido teacher Gerd Kroell Sensei. As such, Nick has been under the tutelage of John Honisz-Green Sensei ever since training alongside Andrew Thrower Sensei also from Sussex. The first Sussex dojo was formed by Nick and Andrew Thrower Sensei in August 2000 in Eastbourne, East Sussex. At that time, Honisz-Greens Sensei was living in Japan and would make regular visits to the UK. During these visits Nick and Andrew Thrower Sensei would arrange intensive study seminars, usually involving more than 25 hours a weekend of floor time, so that the three of them could practice as much as possible whilst Honisz-Greens Sensei was in the UK. Nick has also visited and trained in Japan

Nick had the privilege of being selected to represent Great Britain at the European Iaido Championships held in Paris in 2003. Nick was also won several Iaido competitions and was a vital team member of the winning team in the first BKA held International Iaido Taikai held in 2003.

In 2009 Andrew Thrower Sensei opened a new dojo near his home in Sompting whilst Nick remained in Eastbourne and took over as Dojo Leader. The Eastbourne dojo is both friendly and welcoming. Nick holds the rank of 5th Dan and is eligible to attempt 6th dan in 2022. He also holds a BKA Level 1 Coaching Award.
