John Honisz-Greens Sensei first started training in Iaido as a teenager. His first Iaido teacher was Neil Kemp Sensei whom he met in 1986 in Edinburgh. That training continued until 1989 and stopped after Kemp Sensei relocated. During that time Honisz-Greens Sensei was also practicing Aikijutsu, and his passion for Aiki developed further when he met Gerd Kroell Sensei in 1990, and his subsequent membership of Tai Gyoku Ryu followed. Honisz-Greens Sensei studied for many years under Kroell Sensei, gaining the rank Joden Kyohan and building and developing a great friendship before heading to Japan in 1997. It was in 1997 when he went to Japan that he restarted training in Iaido at the Kobe Shiyakusho Iaido Dojo.

Upon completing his university studies in 1997, and with a job offer from a prestigious bank, Honisz-Greens Sensei negotiated to take a year out in 1997 to develop his Aiki-Jutsu in Japan, He was employed by Hyogo Prefectural Government and was based in Amagasaki City, between Osaka and Kobe. What followed was a career change, further academic study and a prolonged stay of seventeen years in Japan. During this period Honisz-Greens Sensei worked and lived in Osaka, Kobe, Kyoto, Nagoya and Tokyo and as a result he was fortunate enough to meet many great teachers. One such teacher was Honda Masayoshi Sensei, the headteacher of Tokyo Adachi Roshukai.

Honisz-Greens Sensei has studied hard in Japan to develop his Iai, and despite his typically non-Japanese physiology has had some notable successes. As well as competing for both the Hyogo and Gifu prefectural teams whilst training in each prefecture, Sensei has won several individual and team taikai, and been placed in many others. Now, he rarely competes, as he personally feels the art aspect and competitive sport aspect do not mix well for him.

He is the Dojo-cho (Group Leader) of Tokyo Adachi Roshukai UK and supports the training within the Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Scottish Borders Dojo and with frequent trips the Sussex Dojo as well.
